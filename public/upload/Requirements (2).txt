All the functionalities i sent by video must be done.

1.Look at shef.com then Yummymaker.com then the new site New.Yummymaker.com (YOU MUST DO THE WORK ONLY ON new.Yummymaker.com)

2.As long as it has the features and functionalities from 
both my old site and this one then it is fine. We need to 
have the functionality that allows us to have videos on our site to teach live cooking  
We may use youtube video. We need to have our blog page with 
downloadable books we provide free.

I want it to look better and different so people do 
not confuse them. But the I want the same features and functionalities.

4.The registration page must be finished customized, 
membership page finish the design, and add all the functionalities 
we requested including how to place the order.
